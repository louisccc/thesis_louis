% conference papers do not normally have an appendix

As the number of IoT devices grows, it becomes challenging to deploy applications through the network. To make programming on IoT simple is a must, since in the future everyone should be able to interact with IoT network. Make their request throught an user-friendly tool. High-level master knowledge is needed, since IoT middleware should intelligently help programmer to find out their solution to requested IoT application. We can raise the level of programming abstraction. We proposed a service-oriented middleware to suppport programmer to easier deploy their IoT application. In the future, we will further research on semantic matchmaking suppport in IoT middleware. With the aim to support more non-WSN expert to interact with the world of IoT.
